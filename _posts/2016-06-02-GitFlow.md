In SDN world, network is programmable. Anything that is programmable, often revised / modified / changed . And if multiple actors do this change, then what happens ??? 

Sounds like an SCM ( Software Configuration Management ) ?? Exactly..

Recently I came across a research paper, wherein the authors had applied popular GIT revision control over flow management and they claim that, their approach would much benefit in case of multi-cluster / batch transactions.

Check this out :

Especially read the concluding remarks. Very interesting.

Although I knew / understand network is programmable, it didnâ€™t occur to me that, the moment network becomes programmable, all the downsides of software do follow to networking world.

Nothing comes free indeed.
