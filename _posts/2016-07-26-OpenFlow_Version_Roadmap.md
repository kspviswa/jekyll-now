Currently I'm preparing for **ONF Certified Network Associate** exam. One of the impotant topic for this exam is to understand **OpenFlow** protocol.
OpenFlow is the *defacto* standard to interface OpenFlow controller & OpenFlow enabled network elements.

However, this **OpenFlow** protocol had undergone number of changes since its inception. While the differences b/w each version and the features introduced / depreciated in each version can be readily available by reading the OpenFlow specificiations, it would be well understood / recollected, if presented in a pictorial format. 

Hence in this post, I'm attaching 2 pics that depicts the comparison of different OpenFlow versions along with their timeline.
