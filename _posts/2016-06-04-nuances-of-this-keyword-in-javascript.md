In this article, I will talk about different nuances of `this` keyword in Javascript.


## 1) Global `this`

If you access `this` simply without any object reference, then it would simply mean that, you are referring to global `window` object.

For eg:

{% highlight javascript %}
f = function() { this.sampleAttr = 'Viswa'; console.log('This object here is ' + this); }
{% endhighlight %}

Now executing function `f()`
```
f()
VM815:1 This object here is [object Window]
```

## 2) Scoped `this`

Now consider this example

{% highlight javascript %}
obj = {num1:0, add: function(num2) { this.num1 += num2; return this.num1 }}
obj.add(10)
10
obj.add(20)
30
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, inside the `obj's` scope, `this` refers to `obj` object itself, not the global window object.


## 3) `this` outside the function of object's scope

Now consider this example.

{% highlight javascript %}
obj = {num1: 10, 
	   add: function(num2) { 
				console.log("This inside add is " + this); 
				h = function(num2) {
						console.log("This inside h is " + this); this.num1 += num2; }; 
		return h(num2); 
						} 
}

obj.add(20);

VM1973:1 This inside add is [object Object]
VM1973:1 This inside h is [object Window]

undefined
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, inside the `add()`'s scope, `this` was pointing to `obj.this`. However inside the *inner* function `h()` ( even though the scope is within `obj` ), `this` has been reverted to global scope.

### How to solve this problem ?

Take a copy of `obj.this` as `that` and reuse inside `h()`. Complete example given below.

{% highlight javascript %}
obj = {num1: 10, 
	   add: function(num2) { 
			console.log("This inside add is " + this); 
			var that = this; 
			h = function(num2) {
					console.log("That ( this)  inside h is " + that); 
					that.num1 += num2; 
					return that.num1; 
					}; 
			return h(num2); 
		} 
	}
{% endhighlight %}

```
obj.add(20);
VM2045:1 This inside add is [object Object]
VM2045:1 That ( this)  inside h is [object Object]
30

obj.add(20);
VM2045:1 This inside add is [object Object]
VM2045:1 That ( this)  inside h is [object Object]
50
```

## 4) Explicit `this` using `apply()` & `bind()`

If instead of taking a copy of local `this` and re-using it, you actually tell the inner function to get glued to the object itself using `apply()` & `bind()`.

{% highlight javascript %}
obj = {num1: 10, 
	   add: function(num2) { 
			console.log("This inside add is " + this); 
			h = function(num2) {
				console.log("That ( this)  inside h is " + this); 
				this.num1 += num2; 
				return this.num1; }.bind(this); 
			return h(num2); 
			} 
	}
{% endhighlight %}

```
obj.add(20);
VM2092:1 This inside add is [object Object]
VM2092:1 That ( this)  inside h is [object Object]
30

obj.add(20);
VM2092:1 This inside add is [object Object]
VM2092:1 That ( this)  inside h is [object Object]
50
```

## 5) Implicit `this` using a constructor

By default, functions starting with capital letter will be treated like a constructor for that particular construct. In below example, I'm creating a new type called `P`.

{% highlight javascript %}
function P(num) { this.num = num;}

p = new P(10);
{% endhighlight %}

What I did? I simply created a constructor for `P` and assigned the incoming `num` to `P.num`. This is achieved implicitly by using `this` keyword. `p` is filled from prototype `P`.

```
p.num
10
```

Now, let me omit the `new` keyword and call the constructor like a normal function, like this.

```
p1 = P(10);

p1.num
VM2340:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'num' of undefined(â€¦)(anonymous 
```

What just happened ?? There is no member named `num` for `p1` ??? So what's type of `p` then???

```
typeof p
"object"
```

Aha.. `p` is type of generic object, not our mighty `P`. So what about the instruction `this.num = num` would have done ?? You guessed it right. It just added `num` property to global `window` object. Or in other words, `this` pointed to `window` object.

```
window.num
10
```
